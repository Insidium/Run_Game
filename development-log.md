# Development Log

### Dev log entry 1 - *15 November, 2019*:

After planning to develop to two player terminal game that would have a horror theme, I was stopped by a lot of doubts about the app's overly-simple and one-dimensional nature. I consulted the project brief and felt like I wasn't able to provide the amount of value that it required. I spent at least a day trying to reconcile changes I could make or new ideas that may be more suitable, but I got stuck more on these details and became less confident overall. I decided, after discussing the state of things with my Senior Dev, Glen, that the original idea was actually viable and that I could satisfy the criteria if I aimed for an MVP first and then added functionality from there. I proceeded with this in mind.

My aim of developing an MVP was achieved today. Having taken a step back from the muddled ideas of the last week, I was able to find focus in achieving the base competencies expected for the project. I was able to simplify things and develop a single player experience with the secondary interactions coming from a preset computer character. This enabled me to develop more effective game logic rather than trying to battle with two sides of the application at a time. Once I had a working MVP with basic player vs monster model working, I then was able to add additional features like an opening menu, high scores and recent results logs, and also use gems to style the app.
