## Statement of Purpose and Scope

*What is 'RUN!'?*:

'RUN!' is a Player vs Monster terminal mini-game developed in the Ruby language. The aim of the game is to for the player to outlast the monster by fleeing or fighting to survive. 

*The purpose*:

The purpose of 'RUN!' is purely entertainment. It is designed to provide a short yet highly replayable experience of interacting with the terminal for enjoyment and competition. The application does not solve any particular problem save for a few moments of boredom, but that is a noble pursuit in itself. This application has been developed with the passion that drives me to enjoy horror films, gaming, adventure experiences and overall geeky times. I know that it is simple but the simplicity will resonate with likeminds in this space. 

*Target audience*:

The target audience for 'RUN!' is truly anyone. Anyone who likes to play games, interact with computers, relishes competition, or simply wants to pass the time.

*How to play*:

The player enters their name into the terminal upon request and the game begins. The player then selects a room to enter out of a selection of six rooms. If the player enters an empty room, they are then able to select from three options: Rest, Look Around, Change Rooms. If the monster is in the room, a confrontation happens, requiring the player to select their response: Attack or Flee. If Attack is chosen, both characters attack each other for a random hit amount.
