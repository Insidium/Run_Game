*How to play*:

The player enters their name into the terminal upon request and the game begins. The player then selects a room to enter out of a selection of six rooms. If the player enters an empty room, they are then able to select from three options: Rest, Look Around, Change Rooms.

If Attack is chosen, both characters attack each other for a random hit amount.
