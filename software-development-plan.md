# Software Development Plan

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

*What is 'TERROR!'?*:

'TERROR!' is a Player vs Monster terminal mini-game developed in the Ruby language. The aim of the game is for the player to outlast the monster by fleeing or fighting to survive. The player will interact with the terminal by making input selections from preset options and reacting to the resulting outputs. 

*The purpose*:

The purpose of 'TERROR!' is purely entertainment. It is designed to provide a short yet highly replayable experience of interacting with the terminal for enjoyment and competition. The application does not solve any particular problem save for a few moments of boredom, but that is a noble pursuit in itself. This application has been developed with the passion that drives me to enjoy horror films, gaming, adventure experiences and overall geeky times. I know that it is simple but the simplicity will resonate with like minds in this space. 

*Target audience*:

The target audience for 'TERROR!' is truly anyone. Anyone who likes to play games, interact with computers, relishes competition, or simply wants to pass the time. 

*How to play*:

The player inputs their name into the terminal upon request and the game begins. The player then selects a room to enter out of a selection of six rooms. If the player enters an empty room, they are then able to select from three options: Rest, Look Around, Change Rooms. Resting provides a heal effect of +10 health points (but nothing if selected straight away as the player is already at max health). Looking around is currently a ‘wait’ feature as functionality is not yet implemented. Changing rooms will allow the player to select another room to enter. If the Terror is in the room when the player enters a confrontation happens, requiring the player to select their response: Attack or Flee. If Attack is chosen, both characters will attack each other for a random hit amount. If either character is reduced to 0 or less health, the game is over and the result is logged in recent games and high scores files. If not, the characters remaining health is output to the screen  and the player chooses the room to move into next. If Flee is chosen, the player will move into another room of their choice, away from the Terror. The continued risk is that the player will run into the Terror and eventually fight to the death.
